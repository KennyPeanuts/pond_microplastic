## Purpose
A blank sample was created and run through the lab procedure to determine the potential for contamination of the samples with microplastic (esp. the blue threads) during the lab processing.

## Procedure

### 20 April 2017 - Blank Creation

I created a blank sample by adding 100 ml of DI water to a 250 ml glass beaker that had been handled and cleaned the same way as the ones used for the samples.

I then dried this sample at 50 dC in exactly the same way as the other samples.

### 1 May 2017 - Wet Oxidation

The sample was then run through the wet oxidation in the same way as the pond samples.
