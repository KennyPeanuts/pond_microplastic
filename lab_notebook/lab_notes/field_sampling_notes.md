### Pump sampling LPP 2 March 2017

We used a bilge pump to pump water through a 1 mm and 250 um sieves. Using 400 pumps of the pump only samples ~170 L of water which was not enough to effectively collect microplastics at expected densities. We anchored the boat in the middle of LPP and collected 3 replicate samples.  The samples were refrigerated but not counted.

### Net Sampling LPP 16 March 2017

To try sample more water, we used a plankton net with 153 um mesh and a 19.5 cm diameter opening. Thus a 4 m tow of the net samples 0.1196 m^3 of water.  For each replicate we did 10, 4 m horizontal tows to sample a total of 1.196 m^3 of water.  The samples were stored in 250 ml glass bottles in pond water and refrigerated. 

### Net Sampling DP 23 March 2017

For DP we again wanted to increase the volume of water sampled so we used the same procedure as for LPP but did 25, 4 m horizontal tows to sample a total of 2.99 m^3 of water per replicate.  The samples were collected in pond water and refrigerated.  

These tows collected a lot of algae and zooplankton so on 27 March 2017, I preserved the samples in EtOH (95%) by passing the samples through 63 um mesh and then rinsing the samples into a 250 ml glass jar with EtOH.

To count the samples I used a plastic squeezy bulb to transfer some of the sample (after swirling) into the track of a counting wheel.  I then visually searched for plastic in the sample.  I found 73 blue or red plastic fibers in the initial sample but these closely resembled the fibers on the microscope dust cover.  Five subsequent subsamples from the same bottle contained no microplastic fibers, thus I strongly suspect that the fibers were contamination of the workspace by the dust cover.  

It is important that we clean the work surface and all equipment before counting.
