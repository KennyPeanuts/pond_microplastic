## Purpose
These notes are describing the experiments with processing and counting the microplastic samples

## Notes

All of the samples collected with the plankton net were preserved in EtOH (95%) after removing the water from the solids with a 63 um sieve.  

We attempted to visually count the microplasitic in the samples in EtOH using the counting wheel but there were too many ambiguous particles and in DP, there are too many zooplankton to efficiently locate microplastic particles.

Because of these issues we are going to perform a wet oxidation of the organic (i.e., non-plastic) material in the samples before counting.

### Wet Oxidation Procedure

This procedure was modified from [Masura, J. et al. 2015. Laboratory methods for the analysis of microplastics in the marine environment: recommendations for quantifying synthetic particles in waters and sediments. NOAA Technical Memorandum NOS-OR&R-48](https://marinedebris.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/publications-files/noaa_microplastics_methods_manual.pdf)

In our methods the samples were only wet sieved through the 153 um mesh of the plankton net and then collected onto the 60 um mesh sieve to move between water and EtOH.  There was no larger particles evident, so fractioning by size was unneeded.

1. Determine the mass of a clean, dry 500 ml beaker

2. Collect the solid material in the sample onto a 60 um sieve and rinse with DI water.

3. Transfer the solids from the sieve to the beaker with a DI rinse, taking some care to minimize the water volume.

4. Dry the solids in the beaker at 50 dC for at least 48 h.

5. Determine the mass of the beaker and the solids (subtract the beaker mass to get the mass of the solids).

**SAFETY NOTE: Be sure to wear lab coat, safety glasses, and face shield for the next steps**

6. Add 20 ml of aqueous 0.05 M Fe(II) solution to the beaker and gently swirl to loosen the dried solids.

7. Add 20 ml of 30% hydrogen peroxide.  

8. Let the mixture sit for 5 m at room temperature.

**SAFETY NOTE: Have a squeeze bottle of DI water on hand to slow reaction if needed**

9. Add a thermometer to the beaker and cover with a watch glass and heat the sample to 75 dC on a hotplate.

**SAFETY NOTE: Use the hot-mit to handle the hot beaker**

10. As soon as bubbles occur at the liquid surface, remove the beaker from the heat and place into the hood until the boiling stops. 

**SAFETY NOTE: If the mixture appears like it may boil-over, use the squeeze bottle to add DI water and slow the reaction.**

11. Once the boiling has stopped, return the beaker to the hotplate and heat the mixture to 75 dC for 30 minutes, swirl the mixture regularly to mix.

12. If organic material appears to still be present in the sample, add another 20 ml of 30% hydrogen peroxide and repeat steps 8 - 11.

13. Allow the mixture to cool and then collect the un-oxidized solids onto the 60 um sieve and then rinse them into 20 ml glass scintillation vial with DI water.

14. Transfer a subsample of mixture in the vial onto the counting wheel and count the microplastic particles.
