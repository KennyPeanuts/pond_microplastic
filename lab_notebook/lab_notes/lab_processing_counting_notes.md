## Purpose
These notes are describing the experiments with processing and counting the microplastic samples

## Notes

All of the samples collected with the plankton net were preserved in EtOH (95%) after removing the water from the solids with a 63 um sieve.  

We attempted to visually count the microplasitic in the samples in EtOH using the counting wheel but there were too many ambiguous particles and in DP, there are too many zooplankton to efficiently locate microplastic particles.

Because of these issues we are going to perform a wet oxidation of the organic (i.e., non-plastic) material in the samples before counting.

### Wet Oxidation Procedure

This procedure was modified from [Masura, J. et al. 2015. Laboratory methods for the analysis of microplastics in the marine environment: recommendations for quantifying synthetic particles in waters and sediments. NOAA Technical Memorandum NOS-OR&R-48](https://marinedebris.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/publications-files/noaa_microplastics_methods_manual.pdf)

In our methods the samples were only wet sieved through the 153 um mesh of the plankton net and then collected onto the 60 um mesh sieve to move between water and EtOH.  There was no larger particles evident, so fractioning by size was unneeded.

1. Determine the mass of a clean, dry 500 ml beaker

2. Collect the solid material in the sample onto a 60 um sieve and rinse with DI water.

3. Transfer the solids from the sieve to the beaker with a DI rinse, taking some care to minimize the water volume.

4. Dry the solids in the beaker at 50 dC for at least 48 h.

5. Determine the mass of the beaker and the solids (subtract the beaker mass to get the mass of the solids).

**SAFETY NOTE: Be sure to wear lab coat, safety glasses, and face shield for the next steps**

6. Add 20 ml of aqueous 0.05 M Fe(II) solution to the beaker and gently swirl to loosen the dried solids.

7. Add 20 ml of 30% hydrogen peroxide.  

8. Let the mixture sit for 5 m at room temperature.

**SAFETY NOTE: Have a squeeze bottle of DI water on hand to slow reaction if needed**

9. Add a thermometer to the beaker and cover with a watch glass and heat the sample to 75 dC on a hotplate.

**SAFETY NOTE: Use the hot-mit to handle the hot beaker**

10. As soon as bubbles occur at the liquid surface, remove the beaker from the heat and place into the hood until the boiling stops. 

**SAFETY NOTE: If the mixture appears like it may boil-over, use the squeeze bottle to add DI water and slow the reaction.**

11. Once the boiling has stopped, return the beaker to the hotplate and heat the mixture to 75 dC for 30 minutes, swirl the mixture regularly to mix.

12. If organic material appears to still be present in the sample, add another 20 ml of 30% hydrogen peroxide and repeat steps 8 - 11.

13. Allow the mixture to cool and then collect the un-oxidized solids onto the 60 um sieve and then rinse them into 20 ml glass scintillation vial with DI water.

14. Transfer a subsample of mixture in the vial onto the counting wheel and count the microplastic particles.

### Wet Oxidation Notes

#### 30 March 2017 - Drying Samples

To prepare for the wet oxidation we poured the samples (in EtOH) through a 60 um sieve and thoroughly rinsed the jars with DI water through the sieve to make sure that all of the sample was recovered.

We then rinsed the collected material on the sieve into a clean 250 ml glass beaker with DI water. The sieve was rinsed 2X.

The sample was then dried at 50 dC.

#### 6 April 2017 - Wet Oxidation of LPP.A
These are the notes on the first sample we oxidzed. This sample was replicate A from Lance Park Pond.

We followed the procedure above.  When the 30% H2O2 was added the sample turned an amber color and began to bubble with small bubbles. Swirling the sample did not loosen any of the material the as dried to the side of the beaker.

After 5 minutes the sample was still bubbling and we placed it onto the hotplate set to 1.5 with a watchglass over the top and a thermometer in the sample

When the temperature exceeded 50 dC, the reaction became much more violent and we removed the beaker from the heat and allowed the bubbling to cease.

The reaction was very exothermic and the temperature rapidly climbed to 85 dC.

We returned the sample to the heat and turned the hotplate up to 3 and held the sample as close as possible to 75 dC for 30 min, although it fluctuated between 60 and 80 dC. During this time the sample was not bubbling any more but retained the amber color.

After 30 min the sample was removed from the heat and allowed to cool for approx. 10 min. The sample was then poured through a 60 um sieve and the retained material was rinsed into a 20 ml  glass scintillation vial with approx. 10 ml of DI water.

#### 13 April 2017 - Wet Oxidation of DP.B and LPP.B

No notes were collected for LPP - B because the sample behaved the same as LPP - A

The samples from Daulton Pond had a lot of organic matter in them from all the zooplankton and it formed a crust along the sides of the beaker and on the bottom.  To make sure that all of this material was accessible to the oxidizing reagents, we scraped the crust off of the walls of the beaker using a metal spatula.

We followed the same procedure as above but this sample began to boil violently at a lower temperature (< 50 dC).  We added an unknown amount of DI water with a squeeze bottle to try to prevent the sample from boiling over but it did anyway and some sample was lost.  The amount lost was impossible to estimate because of the DI water that we added.

We then completed the oxidation procedure with the remaining sample.

At the end of the oxidation, there was still a lot of OM remaining in the sample so we dried the sample again by passing it through the 60 um sieve and rinsing it back into the beaker with DI water and then placing it into the oven at 50 dC.

#### 20 April 2017 - Cont. Wet Oxidation of DP.B and Wet Oxidation of LPP.C

No notes were collected for LPP - C because the sample behaved the same as LPP - A

We ran the dried sample through the wet oxidation procedure again but avoided sample loss this time.  

At the completion of this procedure, there was still organic matter evident in the sample so we added another 20 ml of 30% H2O2.

The sample was still above 50 dC when we added the H2O2 so it began the exothermic reaction without having to put it back on the hotplate.

When the reaction was completed, we heated the sample to 75 dC for 30 min and collected to remaining material with the 60 um sieve as described above.

#### 1 May 2017 - Wet Oxidation of DP.A and Blank Sample

**More detailed notes on the Blank Sample are recorded in the Lab Notes Folder**

No notes were collected for Blank Sample because the sample behaved the same as LPP - A

DP - A was run through the normal wet oxidation procedure but just as with DP - B, it boiled over during the initial heating and some sample was lost. Again, DI water was added to try to slow the reaction, so the volume of sample cannot be estimated.

As with DP - A considerable organic material remained after the initial oxidation, so another 20 ml of 30% H2O2 was added to the sample. The sample was above 50 dC so the reaction began without having to re-heat on the hotplate.  

After completion of this second oxidation, the sample was collected on a 60 um sieve as described above.
